<p>An operational amplifier (op-amp) is a type of electronic amplifier that is designed to amplify a small input voltage to a large output voltage. It is called an "operational amplifier" because it is designed to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation.</p>



<p>Op-amps are widely used in a variety of electronic circuits, including audio amplifiers, oscillators, filters, and control systems. They are commonly used in applications where a high-gain, high-bandwidth amplifier is needed.</p>



<p>a) its working- working of an op-amp can be understood by considering the</p>

<p>following steps:</p>


<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1","start":1} -->
<ol type="1" start="1"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The input voltage is applied to the input terminals of the op-amp.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The op-amp amplifies the input voltage and produces an amplified output voltage at the output terminal.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The output voltage is then used to drive a load such as a speaker or a display device.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The op-amp continues to amplify the input voltage and produce the amplified output until the output voltage reaches the maximum or minimum limit set by the power supply voltage.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>When the output voltage reaches the maximum or minimum limit, the op-amp saturates and the output voltage remains constant until the input voltage changes.</li>

<p>b) Its characteristic curve-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The characteristic curve of an operational amplifier (op-amp) is a graph that shows the relationship between the input and output voltages of the op-amp. The curve is usually plotted on a graph with the input voltage on the x-axis and the output voltage on the y-axis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The characteristic curve of an op-amp can be divided into three regions: the linear region, the saturation region, and the cutoff region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1","start":1} -->
<ol type="1" start="1"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The linear region: In this region, the op-amp is operating in its linear range and the output voltage is directly proportional to the input voltage. The slope of the curve in this region is equal to the gain of the op-amp.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The saturation region: In this region, the op-amp is saturated and the output voltage is no longer proportional to the input voltage. The output voltage remains constant until the input voltage changes.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The cutoff region: In this region, the op-amp is in the cutoff mode and the output voltage is zero. The input voltage must be greater than a certain threshold value for the op-amp to start amplifying the signal.</li>
